# Resume Evaluator 💼

## 🚀 About the Project

This project aims to **filter and evaluate resumes** to find the ones most suitable for a given job description using AI. The website features two main functionalities:

1. **Single Resume Evaluation**
2. **Multiple Resumes Evaluation**

---

## 📄 Multiple Resumes

This page allows you to select a **folder** containing multiple resumes. It includes the following input fields:

- **Resume Folder:** Select the folder containing the resumes (PDFs).
- **Job Description:** Enter the job description for the role.
- **Threshold Score:** Specify the minimum matching score a resume must have to be shortlisted.

Once the inputs are provided, the resumes are evaluated using AI. Resumes that score **above the threshold** are displayed with their **name** and **email address**.

✅ A **Send Emails** button is available below the results to send emails directly to the shortlisted candidates.

💾 **Note:** All the resumes, along with their **personal information**, **score**, and **evaluation details**, are stored in the **database** for reference and record-keeping.

## 🧪 How to Run the Project

> ⚠️ **Prerequisite:** Ensure [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) is installed on your system.

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Avire-K/Resume-Evaluator.git
    ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd Resume-Evaluator
    ```

3. Install frontend dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Create the **phi4-based Evaluator bot** using Ollama:

    ```bash
    ollama create evaluator -f Modelfile
    ```

   > 🧠 This command creates a custom model named `evaluator` using the specifications provided in the `Modelfile`.  
   > Make sure your `Modelfile` is in the project directory and properly configured with the base model as `phi4`.

   ✅ **Before creating the model**, ensure that `phi4-mini` is present on your device by running:

   ```bash
   ollama run phi4-mini


5. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
