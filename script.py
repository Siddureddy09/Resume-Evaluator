        The given text is extracted from a PDF document, which is a resume. Your task is to identify the different sections present in the resume and structure the information in a JSON format.

        - The **keys** of the JSON object should be the section names (e.g., "Personal Information", "Education", "Work Experience", "Skills", "Projects", etc.).
        - The **values** should be the corresponding content of each section.
        - If a section contains multiple entries (e.g., multiple jobs in "Work Experience" or multiple degrees in "Education"), store the values as an array.
        - Ensure that all relevant sections are captured.
        - **Do not** include any additional text, explanations, or commentsâ€”only return a valid JSON object.

        You are given a job description and a candidate's resume in structured JSON format.

        Job Description:
        {job_description}

        Resume JSON:
        {resume_data}

        Evaluate how suitable this candidate is for the job and provide a JSON response with the following structure:
        {{
            "overallMatch": <percentage_match>,
            "summary": "<brief_evaluation>",
            "skillMatch": {{

            "recommendations": ["<recommendation1>", "<recommendation2>", ...]
        }}

        Your response should contain ONLY the JSON object without any markdown formatting, code blocks, backticks, or additional text.
        First key of the json object should be "Personal Information" which contains an object of 2 keys "Name" and "Email".
        values of these keys should be name and email from that particular Resume JSON. Start the json object with "Personal Information"
        only, you just cannot miss out "Personal Information" in the json object. because the json object that you are generating is direcly
        given to another program to send mails with their name. for this process name and email is very important. if you dont include name
        and email then all the work that you are doing will be wasted.
